  **IMPORTANT**

  Go to the project tab and in the assets folder go to Scenes.

  When in scenes drag and drop "Leo's Final Project" into the hieracrchy and remove the scene that was there.

  After that go to file: Build Profiles

  Switch to Meta Quest and make sure the scene you select to run is "Leo's Final Project"

**Known Issues as well as hardware requirements**

Optimized only for Meta Quest

Some physics interactions may occasionally be inconsistent with high speed ball collisions.

**Future Development Possibilities**

In the  future I would like to add more holes to the course with more complex obstacles.
I would also like to find a way to allow a user to fully customize their ball whether it be with any color they choose or if it is a custom image.
I would like to also develop some type of customize length for the golf club.
